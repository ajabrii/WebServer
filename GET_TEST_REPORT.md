🧪 Web Server GET Method Test Report
=====================================
Date: July 17, 2025
Server: NexWebserv running on port 8085
Total Tests: 38 | Passed: 27 | Failed: 11 | Success Rate: 71%

📋 SUMMARY OF RESULTS
====================

✅ WORKING CORRECTLY (27 tests passed):
- Basic GET functionality (/, /index.html, 404 responses)
- Path normalization (multiple slashes, directory traversal resolution)
- URL decoding (encoded characters properly decoded)
- Query string handling (parameters stripped correctly)
- Most special characters handled appropriately
- Long path handling
- Basic security (some malformed requests handled)
- Content serving (HTML files served with correct content)

❌ ISSUES FOUND (11 tests failed):
1. Header handling problems (3 failures)
2. Fragment/query edge cases (2 failures)  
3. Security test expectations (4 failures)
4. Malformed request handling (2 failures)

📊 DETAILED FAILURE ANALYSIS
============================

🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES:

1. **Header Detection in curl -I (HEAD-like requests)**
   - Tests 32-34: Headers not detected by curl -I
   - ISSUE: Server doesn't respond properly to HEAD-like requests
   - IMPACT: HTTP/1.1 compliance issue
   - SOLUTION: Need to handle HEAD method or fix header response format

2. **Request Parsing Issues**
   - Tests 37-38: Malformed paths cause 000 response (server crash/error)
   - ISSUE: Server crashes or fails to respond on certain malformed inputs
   - IMPACT: Server stability and robustness
   - SOLUTION: Better input validation and error handling

🔶 MINOR ISSUES:

3. **Fragment/Query Edge Cases**
   - Test 20: /test? should return 200 (treats ? as part of path)
   - Test 21: /test#fragment should return 200 (treats # as part of path)
   - ISSUE: Fragment handling not fully HTTP compliant
   - IMPACT: Minor HTTP compliance issue
   - SOLUTION: Better URI parsing for fragments

4. **Security Test Expectations**
   - Tests 28-31: Directory traversal attacks
   - ISSUE: These tests expected 200 but got 404/403
   - IMPACT: Actually GOOD - server is blocking potential attacks
   - SOLUTION: Update test expectations (this is correct behavior)

🔧 RECOMMENDED FIXES
===================

**Priority 1 (Critical):**
1. Fix request parsing to handle malformed inputs gracefully
2. Implement proper HEAD method support or fix header responses
3. Add better error handling for edge cases

**Priority 2 (Minor):**
1. Improve fragment (#) handling in URI parsing
2. Review query string edge cases

**Priority 3 (Nice to have):**
1. Add more comprehensive logging for debugging
2. Implement request sanitization

🎯 EDGE CASES TESTED AND WORKING
===============================

✅ **Path Normalization:**
- Multiple slashes: // → /
- Directory traversal: /../ → /
- Current directory: /./ → /
- Complex paths: /foo/../bar → /bar

✅ **URL Encoding:**
- Encoded characters properly decoded
- Security-related encodings handled

✅ **Query Strings:**
- Simple queries: ?test=1
- Complex queries: ?foo=bar&baz=qux
- Empty queries: ?
- Encoded queries: ?query=hello%20world

✅ **Security:**
- Directory traversal attacks blocked (403/404)
- Null byte attacks blocked (403)
- Most injection attempts blocked (404)

✅ **Content Types:**
- HTML files served with correct MIME types
- Proper content-length headers
- Connection management working

🚀 PERFORMANCE OBSERVATIONS
===========================

- Server handles requests quickly (< 1 second response time)
- Connection keep-alive working correctly
- Memory usage appears stable during testing
- No major performance bottlenecks observed

🎉 CONCLUSION
============

Your web server implementation shows **strong fundamentals** with 71% test success rate. The core GET functionality is working well, including:

- Proper file serving
- Path normalization and security
- Query string handling
- Basic HTTP compliance

**Main areas for improvement:**
1. Handle malformed requests gracefully (prevent 000 responses)
2. Fix HEAD method support or header response format
3. Minor URI parsing improvements

The server successfully blocks most security attacks and handles edge cases well. The path normalization and URL decoding implementations are particularly robust.

**Overall Grade: B+ (Good with some improvements needed)**
